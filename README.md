What does this Looker Block do for me?

There are several high-level dashboards included:
- **1. Leads Capture & Conversion** - Monitor Leads Captured by Source and Industry, status of the Leads and Lead Conversion Trends.
- **2. Opportunity Trends & Pipeline** - Insights on Opportunities in the Pipeline, Opportunity Trends and their value.
- **3. Sales Activities & Engagement** - Monitor Follow-Ups happening for Leads and Opportunities, whether sufficient follow-ups are happening and which Opportunities need immediate follow-up.
- **4. Case Overview & Trends** - Monitor overall status of Cases and their trends by priority and source.
- **5. Case Management & Resolution** - Insights on how Cases are being managed, how fast they are being resolved and how the Agents are performing.
- **6. Accounts with Cases** - Monitor which Accounts have Cases and which should be focused on.

These 6 dashboards are accompanied by 5 supplemental dashboards with pertinent drill information. The dashboards have been organized by relationship to one of the 6 primary dashboards.
(For example, dashboards related to "1. Leads Capture & Conversion" will have titles following this pattern "1_a" "1_b").
